## Abstract
Online social networks have become the most common medium for us to manage our life. Social networks like Facebook, Twitter, and are most visited domains on the Internet. They contain huge data about the users and the relationships among them. These sites allow users to manually categorize their friends into social circles however they are laborious to construct and must be updated whenever a userâ€™s network grows. The data that we are going to analyze is the Facebook ego network. We calculate various metrics for analyzing this ego network and find various circles that combines the network structure as well as user profile. For each circle we learn its members and the circle-specific user profile similarity metric. Along with finding metrics we build a model that can determine whether a node belongs to a circle.
